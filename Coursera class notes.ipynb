    "\n",
    "If you have for example data of house sizes and prices, you can create a regression line. You can make the algorithm to fit a regression line [ straight line or a curved line]. It is important to choose the most appropriate curve, not the most wanted answer. **The goal of is to predict a number from infinitely many possible outputs**\n",

    "  \n",
    "For this you use the function *f<sub>w,b</sub> (x)=wx+b*\n",
    "*w* gives the slope time *x*, *b* gives the starting point on the Y axis (aka y-intercept) \n",
    "   \n",
    "![example of linear model](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/machine-learning-cousera/blob/main/images/linear_model.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cost Function\n",
    "To calculate the value for *w* and *b* so that the predicition *$\\hat{y}$<sup>i</sup>* is close to the true target *y<sup>i</sup>* for many/all training examples, *x<sup>i</sup>*, *y<sup>i</sup>*, you need to construct a cost function. This is mostly done by using the Squared error cost function *J(w,b)$\\frac{1}{2m}$ $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}$ f<sub>w,b</sub>(x<sup>(i)</sup>)-y<sup>(i)</sup>)<sup>2</sup>*, which gives you the error. The goal is to \n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\min_{w,b} imize J w,b$ (little bit weirdly written by me). To do this you can simplyfy the cost function to *f<sub>w</sub>(x)=wx* by saying b= $\\cancel{0}$. This turns the cost function into \n",
    "J(w)$\\frac{1}{2m}$ $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}$ f<sub>w</sub>(x<sup>(i)</sup>)-y<sup>(i)</sup>)<sup>2</sup>* and the goal becomes $\\displaystyle \\min_{w} imize J w$.\n",

    "![setting w to 0](\"https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/machine-learning-cousera/blob/main/images/cost_function_w_1.PNG\")  \n",
    "When testing the simplified cost function, we first try it by setting *w* to 0.   \n",
    "![setting w to 0.5](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis/machine-learning-cousera/blob/main/images/cost_function_w_0.5.png)  \n",
    "this is how it looks setting it to 0.5  \n",

    "Lastly you can see here all the cost functions plotted.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "If we would not simplify the function, but us both *w* and *b* you get instead a 3D plot. This looks something like this:  \n",

    "  \n",
    "The algorithem that can calculate the best value of *w* and *b* is called **Gradient descent**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to classify data into multiple possible outputs. In this case class of categories are used interchangeably and these are what is predicted by the algorithm. You can have multiple inputs. **The goal is to predict a category from a small number of possible outputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data only comes with inputs X, but not output lables Y. Algorithm has to find structures in the data.* The algorithm wont have a right answer to work from. Because of this the algorithm will look for *\"something interesting\"* in the data, like some structure of pattern. Clustering is one of the ways it does that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it will look for clusters of data that are similar. For example, in Google news it might look for words in a headline of a article and look for all the articles that have some of the key words as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it will look for unusual data points. This is often used for fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dimensional reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Compress data using fewer numbers."
